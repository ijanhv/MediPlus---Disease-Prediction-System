In fact, in order to avoid dependency on toxic medicine, people prefer to take modern medicine for short term and switch over to Ayurveda for long-term management of various chronic diseases like Arthritis, Rheumatism, Asthma, Allergy, Skin diseases, Cancer etc. For eg. a diabetic patient & Hypertensive patient who are always prone to develop kidney disease, if they take painkille, there chances of getting renal failure increases by many fold, similarly those who are not so old (below 60-65 yea) and are suffering from Arthritis & want to postpone knee replacement, for their pain management & for preventing further degeneration of joints & for preventing damages to eyes, kidney, liver, Ayurveda medicines by an expert would be the best option for them. Similarly, those who are diagnosed with cancer and are planned for surgery, chemoradiation etc., if they follow the dietary guideline of Ayurveda and certain valuable herbs like Curcumin, Ashwagandha, they will have more chances of having a good quality life & lesser chances of relapse & spread of the disease. Dr. Nitin R Kochar has been treating all these kinds of disease for last 20-21 yea with practice-based evidence.",
